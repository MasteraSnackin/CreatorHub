# CreatorHub

A full-stack Web3 platform integrating eight leading blockchain and decentralized technologies for the Encode London Hackathon. CreatorHub enables seamless interaction with Arbitrum, Concordium, Envio, Story Protocol, Livepeer, Openfort, Hakflow, and Neo—all through a unified, modular interface.

## Features

- **Unified Web3 Dashboard**: Manage bounties, identities, payments, and media across multiple chains and protocols.
- **Modular SDK Integration**: Each supported technology (Arbitrum, Concordium, Envio, Story Protocol, Livepeer, Openfort, Hakflow, Neo) has a dedicated React hook and backend module.
- **Cross-Chain Identity**: Leverage Concordium for decentralized identity and Openfort for seamless login.
- **Decentralized Media**: Integrate Livepeer for video streaming and Story Protocol for IP registration.
- **Smart Contract Security**: Built-in Hakflow audits for all deployed contracts.
- **Scalable Backend**: Node.js API with Rust microservices and Envio-HyperIndex for real-time blockchain data.
- **Easy Deployment**: One-command Docker Compose setup for backend, Vercel for frontend, and testnet support.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/creatorhub.git
cd creatorhub

# Frontend setup
npm install
npm run dev

# Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
npm start

# Envio Data Layer
git clone https://github.com/enviodev/hyperindex
cd hyperindex && npm install && npm run build

# Rust dependencies (Concordium)
rustup install 1.73.0
cargo install cargo-concordium
docker-compose up -d

# See individual module READMEs for further setup.
```

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, modular React hooks for all SDKs
- **Backend**: Node.js Express API, Rust microservice for Concordium, Envio-HyperIndex data streaming
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Arbitrum), Rust Wasm (Concordium), Hakflow security audits
- **Modules**: Each bounty has a dedicated `/modules/<bounty-name>` directory with SDK and API integration

## Module Integration

Each supported technology module includes detailed documentation and example integrations. Refer to the official documentation and GitHub starter kits for each module for SDK and API integration.

## Deployment

1. **Configure Environment**: Set all required API keys and endpoints in `.env` (Openfort, Livepeer Studio, Arbitrum RPC, Concordium endpoint, etc.)
2. **Security Scan**: Run Hakflow pre-submission scan and commit the security report.
3. **Publish**: Push to GitHub (public repo) with README, architecture diagram, and demo video links.
4. **Deploy**: Frontend via Vercel, backend via Docker Compose, smart contracts to Arbitrum Sepolia testnet.

## Demo Deliverables

- **Video Walkthrough**: 3–5 minute demo showing Openfort login, Concordium ID verification, Story Protocol IP registration, Livepeer video streaming, Envio blockchain dashboard, Arbitrum agent payments, Hakflow audit, and Neo tutorial integration.
- **Screenshots**: Include key screens of the platform in action.
- **Architecture Diagram**: Visual overview of system components and data flow.
